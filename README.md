# java-spring-projects
This repo contains multiple projects developed using Java concepts - basic, advanced, and spring boot

## 1. Hotel Reservation Application
In this project, I designed and implemented a Java hotel reservation application. The application allow customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. In this project, I applied my learning in OOPs to design classes, organize and process data with Java collections, and use common Java types.

### Main components of the App
The major components of the Hotel Reservation Application consists of the following:
- **CLI for the User Interface** Here the Command Line Interface (or CLI) is used for the user interface. For this, you'll need to have Java monitor for user input, so the user can enter commands to search for available rooms, book rooms, and so on.
- **Java code** The second main component is the Java code itself, this is where business logic for the app resides.
- **Java collections** Java collections are used for in-memory storage of the data the app needs, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.

### Application Architecture
The app is separated into the following layers:
- **User interface (UI)** including a main menu for the users who want to book a room, and an admin menu for administrative functions.
- **Resources** acts as our Application Programming Interface (API) to our UI.
- **Services** communicates with resources, and each other, to build the business logic necessary to provide feedback to our UI.
- **Data models** is used to represent the domain that we're using within the system (e.g., rooms, reservations, and customers).

### Skills Gained
This project helped me demonstrate my abilities in the following area:

- **Object Oriented Programming**
    - Polymorphism - Created and used Java Interfaces and Inheritance to support polymorphism
    - Data Encapsulation - Defined class variables as private and provide accesor and mutator methods to get and manipulate class variables
    - Use of access modifiers for class variables and methods
    - Override toString method in classes to provide better description of objects
- **Processing and Storing Data using Java Collections**
- **Core Java Concepts**
